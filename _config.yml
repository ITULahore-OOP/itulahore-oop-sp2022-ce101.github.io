# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Object Oriented Programming CE
tagline: Spring 2022 - CE101 - OOP
description: In contrast to procedural programming, object-oriented programming is about identifying and creating objects. They have both functions and data, this help in encapsulating functionality.
  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is the most commonly used mode of computer programming owing to its construction and ability to break down complex problem into simpler components. In this course, C++ language is used to teach the fundamentals of OOP.
