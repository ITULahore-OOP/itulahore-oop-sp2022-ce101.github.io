All programming courses will have two parts (Theory & Lab), these both are graded and evaluated separately, therefore performance in both is required. Breakdown of the percentage for each part of the course is as following:

## Theory
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/course/theory-breakdown.png" %}
![image]({{picURL}})


## Lab
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/course/lab-breakdown.png" %}
![image]({{picURL}})
