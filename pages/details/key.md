## Key:

{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/key.png" %}
![image]({{picURL}})


## Attendance: 
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/attendance.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>
[//]: # (![image]&#40;{{picURL}}&#41;)

* Attendance will be marked in first 5 mins of the lecture, and anyone coming after attendance is marked, he/she will be considered absent.
* University gives you 15 mins break between lectures, therefore consider my lectures to be 15 mins early if you are in habit of being late.
* This 20% margin is to entertain all valid scenarios in life, **anyone going below 80% attendance will not be allowed to sit in the examinations** .


## Attentiveness:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/attentiveness.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>

* You must stay attentive during the lecture, especially when instructor is delivering the concept. Distraction caused to instructor can result in **deduction of one absolute mark** . Possible distraction to instructor is either you are sleeping during the lecture or talking with class fellows.
* You are encouraged to ask questions related to topic or previous topics that we have covered so far, this will help you in grasping the concepts during the lecture time.  


## Time Management:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/time.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>
* Semester System is different from yearly system, here you have to grasp during the lectures, if you delay things till the end of semester, you will possibly be in trouble.
* Since you are studying multiple courses during the semester, therefore managing other courses is your own responsibility.  
* From this course perspective keep in mind that there will / can be a **quiz in every class** .
* There will be **two lab tasks each week** , which will have **deadline of the lab ending timings** . In case you are unable to complete tasks with in lab timings, you can still submit till the **end of day i.e. 11:59 pm, with 75% maximum marks** .
* To lab to be marked, **you must bring printed submission of the task in immediate next lab else it will be marked zero** .
* **Every week you will get an assignment** with **deadline of 11:59 pm of Sunday** night. No late submissions allowed.
* Therefore, it is suggested you create proper time slots for the course to avoid any inconvenience.

## We Attitude:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/we.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>

* We are not in race with each other, therefore helping fellow members will not only help them in learning, but it will enhance your concepts and take you further. Therefore leave ‘ME” attitude of keeping things to yourself and **adopt “WE” attitude** .
* Sharing solutions doesn’t come under “WE” attitude, as that won’t enable your friend or class fellows. That is actually a disservice to them. Enable them by explaining some relevant but different problems than the one assigned in lab or assignment to you.

## Avoid Plagiarism:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/plagiarism.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>

* Plagiarism is presenting work as your submission **when it was not actually produced by you** . This includes copying fellows work, getting work done by seniors, family members or through outsourcing. In all above scenarios we will trace and penalise.
* In case plagiarism is among your class fellows, both will get same penalty, irrespective of your participation as sharer or receiver.
* So to detect this, not only we compare your code, but will also take **viva or quiz** , where we will ask to reproduce same concepts on a different problem, unable to justify, could lead to zero or greater penalty.
* Case count is accumulative for both theory & lab.
* First such case of plagiarism detection will get you (Theory & Lab) **-5% absolute penalty** .
* Second such occurrence will result in **-10% absolute penalty in theory and -20% absolute penalty in lab** .
* Third occurrence will result in **disciplinary committee** , potentially leading to F grade(s).
* If any favour of removing few bad assignments or quizzes is introduced by the instructor at the end of the course, people with even single plagiarism case won’t qualify for it.


## Correlation in Components:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/correlation.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>

* It has been observed that there is a correlation among results, as in if you are performing well in **submission based tasks (Assignments, projects & lab tasks)** , so you should be able to earn similar marks with some small deviation in **evaluations (quizzes & exams)** . In case if the submission based marks are more than reasonable in comparison, your submission based marks will be replaced by evaluation based marks.

## Crystal Clear Concepts:
{% assign picURL = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/images/policy/crystal.png" %}

<p align='center'>
  <img src='{{picURL}}' />
</p>

* In semester system every lecture / topic is connected to next topic, similarly every course is connected to next course. If you don’t keep your concepts clear, you might not only suffer in the respective course but that deficiency might carry on for the complete chain of courses.
* Forget about rote learning, focus on concepts, understanding and skills.
* If you keep discipline and ethics mentioned above, with eagerness to learn, you have In sha Allah a very bright future ahead. **Happy Learning** . :)
